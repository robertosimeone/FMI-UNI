ed a node structure
Need a tree structure
for every single node i need to know the condition
for every single node i need to know the table and count of every single thing in order to calculate gain
if entropy is zero its a leaf node
if there are less than k samples in a node, it's a leaf and i get the majority decision from the node as the class
if i dont wanna calculate a new table again just make ls
